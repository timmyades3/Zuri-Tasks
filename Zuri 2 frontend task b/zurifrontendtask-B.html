                    <strong>Bill Gates</strong> is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. He grew up in
                    Seattle,
                    Washington, with an amazing and supportive family who encouraged his interest in computers at an
                    early age. He dropped out of college to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Today,
                    <strong>Bill</strong> co-chairs the <strong>Bill</strong> & Melinda Gates Foundation with Melinda
                    French Gates, where he works to give
                    his wealth back to society.<strong>Bill</strong> grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. His late
                    father, William H.
                    Gates Sr., was a Seattle attorney and one of the co-chairs of the <strong>Bill</strong> & Melinda
                    Gates Foundation.
                    His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of
                    United Way International. <strong>Bill</strong> has three children.

                    When <strong>Bill</strong> and <strong>Paul Allen</strong> started Microsoft, their vision of “a
                    computer on every desktop and in
                    every home” seemed farfetched to most people. Today, thanks to Microsoft and many other companies,
                    that vision is a reality in many parts of the world, and personal technology is an integral part of
                    society.<strong>Bill</strong> is passionate about Microsoft’s work and will always be involved with
                    the company,
                    including
                    his present role as a member of the board and technology advisor.
